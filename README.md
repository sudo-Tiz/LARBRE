# What is LARBRE ?

LARBRE contains documentation and scripts for installing arch linux encrypted with Xorg or Wayland.

## First steps

## Xorg

An automated script called [larbs.sh](/larbs.sh) (created by [Luke Smith](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS)) can be used to install an desktop environment based on theses [dotfiles](https://github.com/sudo-Tiz/dotfiles).

Run blindfolded or read the [documentation](/larbs.md)
